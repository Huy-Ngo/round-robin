# Round robin scheduler

This is task scheduler for, based on the idea of round robin in the
context of process scheduler in operating system. This helps avoiding
concentrating too much on one thing and forget doing other tasks.

# Usage

This is intentional for local usage. I would like to host it on a website
too, but I don't have time for now.

This scheduler is using Flask, and if you want to use it then go to their
page and see it for yourself.
